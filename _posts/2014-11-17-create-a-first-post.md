# Create a first post

Once you've created your gh-pages site,

* Switch to the gh-pages branch
* Create a new file called _posts/YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
  * Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
